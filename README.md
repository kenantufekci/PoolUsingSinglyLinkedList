## Class PSLL

## Pool Private Functions 

bool isPoolEmpty(): This is the private function that is used to determine if the pool list that contains the blank nodes is empty. If the poolHead pointer equals NULL then true is returned else false.

int poolSize(): This is the private function that is used to get the integer value of the number of pool nodes that are stored in the pool list. The temp pointer is set to poolHead then the list is traversed while a counter is incremented every time a new node is reach. Once the end of the list is found the counter is returned.

void resizePool(): This is the private function that is used to resize the pool list when a certain limit is reached. The limit is checked inside of the public function and this function is called at from there. A node pointer is set to poolHead then the pool list is traversed to approximately half way deleting each node along the way.


## Constructor/Destructor/Overloaded Operators 

PSLL(): This is the default constructor this method is supposed to create an instance of the class SSLL at set head, tail pointer to NULL, and poolHead to NULL indicating an empty instance.

PSLL(const SSLL& src): This is the method for the copy constructor. Head will be set to NULL and *this = src will call the overloaded equals operator.

~PSLL(): This method calls the clear function

PSLL& operator=(const PSLL& src): This is the overloaded equals operator and instance of SSLL src will be passed into the function as const and will be used to set the current class instance to its values. If &src equals this checking for self-assignment then nothing is done and *this is returned. Otherwise, the clear method is called and the current class instance is cleared out and then each value in src is then set to the current class instance. Finally, *this is returned.

T& operator[](int i): This is the overloaded [] operator that will return the address of a value at a specific index int i. The first thing that this function should check is if the list is empty, if it is empty then an domain_error exception should be thrown. The next check should be if int i is equal to head index if so then return the head->data value. The next check if is int i is equal to the tail index, if so then return the tail->data value. For all other cases the function traverse the linked list to find the node index that matches int i, once the node is found the return the currentNode->data value.

const T& operator[](int i): This is the overloaded [] operator that will return the address of a value at a specific index int I to an immutable const value. The first thing that this function should check is if the list is empty, if it is empty then a domain_error exception should be thrown. The next check should be if int i is equal to head index if so then return the head->data value. The next check if is int i is equal to the tail index, if so then return the tail->data value. For all other cases the function traverse the linked list to find the node index that matches int i, once the node is found the return the currentNode->data value.

## Member Functions

T replace(const T& element, int position): This function is used to replace a value in the list with the value element at position that are passed into the function. The first part of this function checks if the list is empty, if so then an domain_error exception is thrown. The second check is if the int position is outside the range of index values possible for negative values and values that are beyond the end of the max list index, if so then an out_of_range exception is thrown. The next check is if the value for position is equal to 0 or the head node, if so, the old value that is in head->data is saved and element is save into head->data then the old value is returned. The next check is if the value for position is equal to size()-1 or the tail node, if so the old value that is in tail->data is saved and element is save into tail->data then the old value is returned. For all other cases the linked list will be traverse until the node number matches position, once the node is found then the old value that is in the currentNode is saved then replaced with element and the old value is returned.

void insert(const T& element, int position): When adding a node in this function first the pool list is checked to see if there are available nodes, else a new node is dynamically allocated. This is the function used to insert an element in position passed into the function. The first check is to see if the list is empty if it is then element is placed in the first index of the list. The next check if position is outside the range of index values possible for negative values and values that are beyond the end of the max list index, if so then an domain_error exception is thrown. The next check is to see if position is equal to zero or the head node, if so, then push_front is called to put the element in the front of the list. The next check is to see if position is equal to size()-1 or the tail node, if so, then push_back is called to put the element in the back of the list. For all other cases the linked list will be traverse until the node number matches position, once the node is found a new node is created to contain element and the previousNode->next will point the newNode and newNode->next will now point to currentNode inserting the newNode in between the two nodes.

void push_front(const T& element): When adding a node in this function first the pool list is checked to see if there are available nodes, else a new node is dynamically allocated. This function the used to add values to the front of the list the first check is to see if the list is empty, if so, then a new node is create with element and the head and tail is set to point to newNode. If the list is not empty the then the new node that was created to contain element will be placed in the front of the list by setting the head pointer to point to newNode and newNode->next to point to the first element in the list.

void push_back(const T& element): When adding a node in this function first the pool list is checked to see if there are available nodes, else a new node is dynamically allocated. This function the used to add values to the back of the list the first check is to see if the list is empty, if so, then a new node is create with element and the head and tail is set to point to newNode. If the list is not empty the then the new node that was created to contain element will be placed in the front of the list by setting the head pointer to point to newNode and newNode->next to point to the last element in the list.

T pop_front():When removing a node in this function first the node is removed from the list then added to the pool list as poolHead pushing it in the front of the pool list. In this function the first element in the list will be removed from the front of the list and returned. The first check is to see if the list is empty, if so, throw an exception domain_error. For all other cases the head- >data will be saved to element and returned and the node will be deleted from the list.

T pop_back():When removing a node in this function first the node is removed from the list then added to the pool list as poolHead pushing it in the front of the pool list. In this function the first element in the list will be removed from the front of the list and returned. The first check is to see if the list is empty, if so, throw an exception domain_error. For all other cases the tail- >data will be saved to element and returned and the node will be deleted from the list.

T remove():When removing a node in this function first the node is removed from the list then added to the pool list as poolHead pushing it in the front of the pool list. In this function the element in the list will be removed from the position of the list and returned. The first check is to see if the list is empty, if so, throw an exception domain_error. The second check is if the position that was passed in is an invalid index, if so, throw the exception out_of_range. For all other cases the currentNode->data will be saved to element and returned and the node will be deleted from the list.

T item_at(): In this function the element in the list located at position will be returned by value. The first check is to see if the list is empty, if so, throw an exception domain_error. The second check is if the position that was passed in is an invalid index, if so, throw the exception out_of_range. If position equals 0 then the value from head->data is returned. If position equal size() â€“ 1, then the value from tail->data is returned. For all other cases the list is traversed and the currentNode->data will be saved to element and returned.

T is_empty(): This function return if tail == NULL if this is true then the list is empty else the list has element.

T size(): In this function the number of element is the list will be returned. A currentNode pointer will point to the head of the list and then the list will be traversed and till NULL is reached meaning the end of the list is reached. An int counter will be incremented every time a node is traversed the counter will be incremented and then when the end of list is reach the counter is returned.

T clear(): In this function all the dynamically allocated pointers and nodes will be deleted. A node pointer is set to head and the list will be traversed deleting every node along the way until the end of the list is reached.

bool conatins(const T& element, bool(*ftpr)(const T& a, const T& b)) const(): In this function that take in a T element and a function pointer to a function that compare element of type T and returns true if they are equal or false if not. The list will start from the beginning and search every element in the list if one of the element in the list match the item that was passed into the function then true is returned. If the end of the list is reached without a match then false is returned.

std::ostream& print(std::ostream& out) const: In this function all the element will be printed to the console. If the list is empty then <Empty List> will be printed, else the list will start from the beginning and print eer element out [1, 2, 3, ...] until the end of the list.
